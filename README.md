My name is Tony, currently a engineering/computer science student, that wants to apply skills learnt into the financial industry.

My career goals is to learn about newer technologies that are applicable to the future, and work with a company using these technologies to change the world.

FinTech is a great career path because i think the landscape of finance will change with blockchain technolgies.
